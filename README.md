# About

This GameApp focusing on explaining about my favourite game namedd Uncharted 4 : A Theif End.<br>
Moreover, software contains ai which can imitate some characters from the game.<br>
Despite ai, application's unique side is quests which goes same as plot of the game<br>
You cant undestand experience this game's ambience without playing or accomplishing this game<br>

# Building and Running
***Compatible only with IOS(but i will make the project crossplatform)***

1. First Way to build and run

> **Windows ONLY**
>
> - Git bash for windows to run the script
> - `wget` is a requirement for the script, download it from [here](https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/), then put it in this folder: `%PROGRAMFILES%/Git/usr/bin`

> **Linux ONLY**
>
> - `git` is a requirement for the script, download it using this command: `sudo apt install git`
> - `wget` is a requirement for the script, download it using this command: `sudo apt install wget`

```sh
git clone link of project
cd scripts
./install_flutter.sh (if you dont have flutter on your device)
./build.bash
./Run.bash and choose platform
```
2.Second way<br>
[Download](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows/mobile#:~:text=Download%20then%20install%20Flutter) - install flutter

```sh
git clone link of project
cd scripts
./build.bash
./Run.bash and choose platform
```

# Development

Firstly, i started working on the UI,since it is easier to write code after visualizing the page or components<br>
Secondly, since application has 5 pages a started everything from the hard parts,For example i started doing quest and dynamic search before entry page<br>
Thirdly, as a game developer i was trying to separate the components into little models to make development easier<br>
Additionally, at the end i completed some problems related to search and quests visibility<br>

# Unique approach, methodology

I used Agile methodology for development. Since, this methodology means that code or product might be changed in future<br>
At the first,i couldnt see how this would look like,So to improvise i used this approach to write code<br>
And how i mention i was separating code into littlier pieces,Therefore, it was more approachable and easier to modify the code<br>
In my opinion, code was written in bad way.Because, there is no opttimization and just syntactic sugar.Moreover, no structured architecture<br>
Project needs huge refactoring<br>

# Ð¡ompromise

I would like to mention that, I HAVE NEVER DONE APPLICATIONS and this is my first<br>
Despite this fact i can create decent project<br>
During the project i spent most of my time to learn the language and architecture of the application<br>
Firstly, i wanted to create like a game quests,but because of time i just improvized it as a text<br>
Secondly, i wanted to create or connect API from LLM but because of skill issues i just integrated Gemini API and set some propert(but result actually same)<br>
I was thinking to create database using MySql to save quest data.Unfortunately, deadline was so close that i refused to do that<br>

# Errors

I would say there might be 2 issues.<br>
Firstly, during dynamic search if you typed text in russian or kazakh or in any language,it possibly will not work.<br>
Secondly,adjusting problems,this type of error might happen. It depends on resolution and size of the phone.<br>

# Technology

I usef Flutter,Vs Code and Gemini Api<br>
Flutter is the language with low entry threshold.It is only lanugage that doesnt need other frameworks and dependencies.Moreover flutter was written in c++ and syntax actually similar.Therefore i chose this language<br>
Next is IDE,There is no explanation.Vs code just best dynamic and convenient IDE for software development(but visual studio 2022 is better for c,c++).<br>
Gemini API has the same search abilities like OPENAI.Additionally, OPENAI is not free.Integrating and connecting Gemini Api is just easier and handy.<br>

THANKS FOR ATTENTION!!!
